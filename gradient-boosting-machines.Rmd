## Introduction

[Gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) is a
machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which
produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction
models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in an iterative fashion
like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization
of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

It is recommended that you read through the accompanying [Classification and
Regression Trees Tutorial](decision-trees.ipynb) for an overview of decision
trees.

## History

Boosting is one of the most powerful learning ideas introduced in the last
twenty years. It was originally designed for classification problems, but it can
be extended to regression as well. The motivation for boosting was a procedure
that combines the outputs of many "weak" classifiers to produce a powerful
"committee."  A weak classifier (e.g. decision tree) is one whose error rate is
only slightly better than random guessing.

[AdaBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost) short for "Adaptive
Boosting", is a machine learning meta-algorithm formulated by [Yoav
Freund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Freund) and [Robert
Schapire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schapire) in 1996, which is now
considered to be a special case of Gradient Boosting.  There are [some
differences](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/164233/intuitive-
explanations-of-differences-between-gradient-boosting-trees-gbm-ad) between the
AdaBoost algorithm and modern Gradient Boosting.  In the AdaBoost algorithm, the
"shortcomings" of existing weak learners are identified by high-weight data
points, however in Gradient Boosting, the shortcomings are identified by
gradients.

The idea of gradient boosting originated in the observation by Leo Breiman that
boosting can be interpreted as an optimization algorithm on a suitable cost
function. Explicit regression gradient boosting algorithms were subsequently
developed by Jerome H. Friedman, simultaneously with the more general functional
gradient boosting perspective of Llew Mason, Jonathan Baxter, Peter Bartlett and
Marcus Frean. The latter two papers introduced the abstract view of boosting
algorithms as iterative functional gradient descent algorithms. That is,
algorithms that optimize a cost function over function space by iteratively
choosing a function (weak hypothesis) that points in the negative gradient
direction. This functional gradient view of boosting has led to the development
of boosting algorithms in many areas of machine learning and statistics beyond
regression and classification.

In general, in terms of model performance, we have the following heirarchy:

$$Boosting > Random \: Forest > Bagging > Single \: Tree$$

## Gradient Boosting

[Gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) is a
machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which
produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction
models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion
like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization
of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

The purpose of boosting is to sequentially apply the weak classification
algorithm to repeatedly modified versions of the data, thereby producing a
sequence of weak classifiers $G_m(x)$, $m = 1, 2, ... , M$.

## Stagewise Additive Modeling

Boosting builds an additive model:

$$F(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M \beta_m b(x; \gamma_m)$$

where $b(x; \gamma_m)$ is a tree and $\gamma_m$ parameterizes the splits.  With
boosting, the parameters, $(\beta_m, \gamma_m)$ are fit in a *stagewise*
fashion.  This slows the process down, and overfits less quickly.

## AdaBoost

- AdaBoost builds an additive logistic regression model by stagewise fitting.
- AdaBoost uses an exponential loss function of the form, $L(y, F(x)) =
exp(-yF(x))$, similar to the negative binomial log-likelihood loss.
- The principal attraction of the exponential loss in the context of additive
modeling is computational; it leads to the simple modular reweighting
- Instead of fitting trees to residuals, the special form of the exponential
loss function in AdaBoost leads to fitting trees to weighted versions of the
original data.

## Gradient Boosting Algorithm

Friedman's Gradient Boosting Algorithm for a generic loss function, $L(y_i,
\gamma)$:

### Loss Functions and Gradients

The optimal number of iterations, T, and the learning rate, λ, depend on each
other.




## Stochastic GBM

[Stochastic Gradient Boosting](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/stobst.pdf)
(Friedman, 2002) proposed the stochastic gradient boosting algorithm that simply
samples uniformly without replacement from the dataset before estimating the
next gradient step. He found that this additional step greatly improved
performance.

## Practical Tips

- It's more common to grow shorter trees ("shrubs" or "stumps") in GBM than you
do in Random Forest.
- It's useful to try a variety of column sample (and column sample per tree)
rates.
- Don't assume that the set of optimal tuning parameters for one implementation
of GBM will carry over and also be optimal in a different GBM implementation.

# GBM Software in R

This is not a comprehensive list of GBM software in R, however, we detail a few
of the most popular implementations below:
[gbm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/index.html),
[xgboost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/index.html) and
[h2o](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gamboostLSS/index.html).

The [CRAN Machine Learning Task
View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html) lists the
following projects as well.  The Hinge-loss is optimized by the boosting
implementation in package
[bst](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bst/index.html). Package
[GAMBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GAMBoost/index.html) can be
used to fit generalized additive models by a boosting algorithm. An extensible
boosting framework for generalized linear, additive and nonparametric models is
available in package
[mboost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mboost/index.html). Likelihood-
based boosting for Cox models is implemented in
[CoxBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CoxBoost/index.html) and for
mixed models in
[GMMBoost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GMMBoost/index.html). GAMLSS
models can be fitted using boosting by
[gamboostLSS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gamboostLSS/index.html).

Vignette](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-
docs/booklets/GBMBooklet.pdf).

Features:

- Distributed and parallelized computation on either a single node or a multi-
node cluster.
- Automatic early stopping based on convergence of user-specied metrics to user-
specied relative tolerance.
- Stochastic GBM with column and  row sampling  (per split and per tree) for

functions in addition to binomial (Bernoulli), Gaussian and multinomial
distributions, such as Quantile regression (including Laplace).

- Data-distributed, which means the entire dataset does not need to fit into
memory on a single node, hence scales to any size training set.
- Uses histogram approximations of continuous variables for speedup.

split bins' min and max values discovered during the last pass.
- Uses squared error to determine optimal splits.

post](http://blog.h2o.ai/2013/10/building-distributed-gbm-h2o/) by Cliff Click.

Note that all models, data and model metrics can be viewed via the [H2O Flow

since you started the H2O cluster with `h2o.init()`.

```{r   n=77}
# Early stopping example
# Keep in mind that when you use early stopping, you should pass a validation set
# Since the validation set is used to detmine the stopping point, a separate test set should be used for model eval

The grid search helped a lot.  The first model we trained only had a 0.774 test
set AUC, but the top GBM in our grid has a test set AUC of 0.786.  More
information about grid search is available in the [H2O grid search R
tutorial](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/blob/master/h2o-open-
