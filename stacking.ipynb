    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "[Stacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning#Stacking) (sometimes called \"stacked generalization\") involves training a learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms. First, all of the other algorithms are trained using the available data, then a combiner algorithm, the *metalearner*, is trained to make a final prediction using all the predictions of the other algorithms as additional inputs. If an arbitrary metalearning algorithm is used, then stacking can theoretically represent any of the ensemble techniques described in this article, although in practice, a single-layer [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) model is often used for metalearning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacking typically yields performance better than any single one of the trained models in the ensemble."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[Leo Breiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Breiman), known for his work on classification and regression trees and the creator of the Random Forest algorithm, formalized stacking in his 1996 paper, [\"Stacked Regressions\"](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/tech-reports/367.pdf). Although the idea originated with David Wolpert in 1992 under the name \"Stacked Generalization\", the modern form of stacking that uses internal k-fold cross-validation was Dr. Breiman's contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it wasn't until 2007 that the [theoretical background](http://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1544-6115.1309) for stacking was developed, which is when the algorithm took on the name, \"Super Learner\". Until this time, the mathematical reasons for why stacking worked were unknown and stacking was considered a \"black art.\" The Super Learner algorithm learns the optimal combination of the base learner fits. In an article titled, \"Super Learner\", by Mark van der Laan et al., proved that the Super Learner ensemble represents an asymptotically optimal system for learning.\n",

    "## The Super Learner Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A common task in machine learning is to perform model selection by specifying a number of models with different parameters.  An example of this is Grid Search.  The first phase of the Super Learner algorithm is computationally equivalent to performing model selection via cross-validation.  The latter phase of the Super Learner algorithm (the metalearning step) is just training another single model (no cross-validation) on the *level one* data.  \n",
