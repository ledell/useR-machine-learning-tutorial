    "Classification and regression trees (CART) are a non-parametric [decision tree learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) technique that produces either classification or regression trees, depending on whether the dependent variable is categorical or numeric, respectively.  CART is both a generic term to describe tree algorithms and also a specific name for Breiman's original algorithm for constructing classification and regression trees.\n",

    "- **Decision Tree:** A tree-shaped graph or model of decisions used to determine a course of action or show a statistical probability.\n",
    "- **Classification Tree:** A decision tree that performs classification (predicts a categorical response).\n",
    "- **Regression Tree:** A decision tree that performs regression (predicts a numeric response).\n",
    "- **Split Point:** A split point occurs at each node of the tree where a decision is made (e.g. x > 7 vs. x &leq; 7).\n",
    "- **Terminal Node:** A node terminal node is a node which has no decendants (child nodes).  Also called a \"leaf node.\""

    "## Tree Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a handful of different tree algorithms in addition to Breiman's original CART algorithm.  Namely, [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm), [C4.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm) and [C5.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm#Improvements_in_C5.0.2FSee5_algorithm), all created by [Ross Quinlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Quinlan).  C5.0 is an improvement over C4.5, however, the C4.5 algorithm is still quite popular since the multi-threaded version of C5.0 is proprietary (although the single threaded is released as GPL). \n",
    "\n",
    "## CART vs C4.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the differences between CART and C4.5:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tests in CART are always binary, but C4.5 allows two or more outcomes.\n",
    "- CART uses the Gini diversity index to rank tests, whereas C4.5 uses information-based criteria.\n",
    "- CART prunes trees using a cost-complexity model whose parameters are estimated by\n",
    "cross-validation; C4.5 uses a single-pass algorithm derived from binomial confidence\n",
    "limits.\n",
    "- With repsect to missing data, CART looks for surrogate tests that approximate the outcomes when the tested attribute has an unknown value, but C4.5 apportions the case probabilistically among the outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are formed by a collection of rules based on variables in the modeling data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rules based on variables' values are selected to get the best split to differentiate observations based on the dependent variable.\n",
    "2. Once a rule is selected and splits a node into two, the same process is applied to each \"child\" node (i.e. it is a recursive procedure).\n",
    "3. Splitting stops when CART detects no further gain can be made, or some pre-set stopping rules are met. (Alternatively, the data are split as much as possible and then the tree is later pruned.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each branch of the tree ends in a terminal node. Each observation falls into one and exactly one terminal node, and each terminal node is uniquely defined by a set of rules."

Gini impurity can be computed by summing the probability $f_i$ of each item being chosen times the probability $1 − f_i$ of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when all cases in the node fall into a single target category.\n",
